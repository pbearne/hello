This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong.

== Description ==
This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong: Hello, Dolly. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from Hello, Dolly in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.


== Installation ==
Hello Dolly is installed as part of core. If you have deleted it you can reinstall Hello Dolly using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download BuddyPress manually, make sure it is uploaded to \"/wp-content/plugins/buddypress/\".

Activate Hello Dolly in the \"Plugins\" admin panel using the \"Activate\" link. If you\'re using WordPress Multisite, you can choose to activate BuddyPress network wide for full integration with all of your site.
